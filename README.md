 Assignment: Introduction to Python

1. **Python Basics**:
   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Some key features include:
     - Readability: Python code is easy to read and understand, making it accessible to beginners and experienced developers alike.
     - Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library, offering modules and packages for various tasks such as string manipulation, file I/O, and networking.
     - Dynamically Typed: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.
     - Versatility: Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
   - Use Cases: Python is particularly effective in web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask), data analysis and visualization (with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib), machine learning and artificial intelligence (with libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch), automation, scripting, and more.

2. **Installing Python**:
   - The steps for installing Python vary slightly depending on the operating system, but generally involve downloading the installer from the official Python website (python.org), running it, and following the installation prompts. Once installed, you can verify the installation by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `python --version`. To set up a virtual environment, you can use the `venv` module:
     ```
     python3 -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
     myenv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
     ```

3. **Python Syntax and Semantics**:
   ```python
   # Simple Python program to print "Hello, World!" to the console
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
   - Basic Syntax Elements:
     - `print()`: Function used to output text to the console.
     - `"Hello, World!"`: String literal enclosed in double quotes.

4. **Data Types and Variables**:
   - Basic Data Types: Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more.
   ```python
   # Script demonstrating variables of different data types
   my_integer = 42
   my_float = 3.14
   my_string = "Hello, World!"
   my_boolean = True
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```
   
5. **Control Structures**:
   - Conditional Statements:
     ```python
     x = 10
     if x > 5:
         print("x is greater than 5")
     else:
         print("x is less than or equal to 5")
     ```
   - Loops:
     ```python
     for i in range(5):
         print(i)
     ```

6. **Functions in Python**:
   - Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, promoting reusability, and improving readability. Here's a function that adds two numbers:
   ```python
   def add_numbers(a, b):
       return a + b

   result = add_numbers(3, 5)
   print(result)  # Output: 8
   ```

7. **Lists and Dictionaries**:
   - Lists: Ordered collections of items. Access items by index.
   - Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Access values by keys.
   ```python
   # Script demonstrating lists and dictionaries
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

   # Accessing elements
   print(my_list[0])      # Output: 1
   print(my_dict["b"])    # Output: 2

   # Adding elements
   my_list.append(6)
   my_dict["d"] = 4

   # Length of list/dictionary
   print(len(my_list))    # Output: 6
   print(len(my_dict))    # Output: 4
   ```

8. **Exception Handling**:
   - Exception handling allows you to gracefully handle errors in Python programs. Here's an example:
   ```python
   try:
       result = 10 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError as e:
       print("Error:", e)
   finally:
       print("This will always execute")
   ```

9. **Modules and Packages**:
   - Modules are Python files containing functions, classes, and variables. Packages are directories containing multiple modules. You can import modules using the `import` statement:
   ```python
   import math

   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
   ```

10. **File I/O**:
    - You can read from and write to files using built-in functions like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`. Here's an example:
    ```python
    # Reading from a file
    with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)

    # Writing to a file
    lines = ["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n", "Line 3\n"]
    with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
        file.writelines(lines)
    ```
